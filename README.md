# learn-file-storage-s3-typescript-starter

This repo contains the starter code for the Tubely application. It's for the "Learn File Servers and CDNs with S3 and CloudFront" [course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-file-servers-s3-cloudfront-typescript) on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev)
I followed the course and built ontop of the code. Currently it's configured to run on aws Cloudfront.
